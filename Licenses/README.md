## Description

Putting everything I'll ever need in a repository because otherwise I can never find anything I need.


## Licenses

When putting one of these license files in your project, you should rename it to LICENSE (without a file extension) and put it in the root directory (eg. `your-project/`).

You should also change the license's contents to fit your project and organization.
